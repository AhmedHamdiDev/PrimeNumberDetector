This Project is meant to be used as a primality tester for integers.

1. Enter your number
2. The algorithm will test your number for primality
3. If the number is prime it will say so, if not it will say so

Note: The primality of a negative number is found by testing for primality of its absolute value. It's a subtle detail in abstract algebra. If you think that it's a bug know that it isn't.
